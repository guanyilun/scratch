# Experiment with program metamorphism
## attempt 1
- [X] start by reimplementing jax function transformation
- [ ] automatic primitive definition

## mock
=unittest.mock= provides an interesting path for metamorphic programming as it allows one to patch part of the function without actually modifying the function itself.
