# Lensing Reconstruction
In this scratch space, I try to make minimal working examples of various lensing reconstruction recipes hoping that they will be useful in the future.

## flat-sky lensing reconstruction recipe
- `recon_2d.py`: `symlens`-based flat-sky lensing reconstruction code.

## full-sky lensing simulation recipe
`make_lensed_sim.py`: make full-sky lensed cmb sim using CAR pixelization. E.g.
```bash
python make_lensed_sim.py --odir out --sim_num 0
```
